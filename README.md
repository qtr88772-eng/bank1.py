Data Loading

Read bank.csv using pandas.read_csv().

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., job, marital, education).

Scaled numerical features if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used df.describe(), df.info().

Visualized distributions (histograms, box plots).

Checked correlations (heatmap with seaborn).

Feature Engineering

Created new features if needed (e.g., age groups, balance categories).

Model Building (if ML was used)

Split data into train/test.

Built a classifier (likely RandomForest, LogisticRegression) to predict deposit (target).

Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve.

Streamlit Dashboard

Built interactive widgets (dropdowns, sliders,streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
scipy
scikit-learn).

Displayed tables, charts, model results.

📈 Typical Visualizations You Might Have Created:
Count plot of deposit (target variable).

Age vs. Balance scatter plot.

Job-wise subscription rate (bar chart).

Correlation heatmap.

Model performance metrics.
